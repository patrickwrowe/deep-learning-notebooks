# Deep Learning - Personal Notes and Notebooks

 This repository is a personal, work-in-progress collection of notes and Jupyter notebooks documenting my journey through the Dive Into Deep learning textbook, into the fascinating world of deep learning. The notes are written in markdown and the notebooks are written in Python using Jupyter. The notes are intended to be a concise summary of the key concepts and the notebooks are intended to be a practical demonstration of the concepts. The notes and notebooks are a work-in-progress and will be updated as I progress through the textbook. The notes and notebooks are intended to be a personal reference for me, but perhaps they may be useful to others as well.
